## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this challenge i decided to work with CSS Grid instead of Flexbox to learn more about it and the different things i can do with it, even though i found it to be a little bit more difficult than Flexbox i think it's very useful and i can think of some situations where it would be more convenient to use CSS Grid instead of Flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is a complete guide to CSS Grid that helped me to implement it for this challenge.
